            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>When I started college my first semster of engineering was primarily coding, and I had to apply that knowledge in a group project in the second semester. I found that I really enjoyed coding, and when engineering didn't work out and I entered the workforce that stuck with me. As a machinist I was asked to take over programing the robotic arms they used to load and unload machines, and it finally occured to me that I could make a career out of this. I consulted with friends that had gone through coding bootcamps and entered the field, and once I had saved up enough to make the switch I started at We Can Code it.</p>

            <p>My skills include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
            </ul>
