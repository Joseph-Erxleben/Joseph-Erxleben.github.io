            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>When I started college my first semster of engineering was primarily coding, and I applied that knowledge in group projects during my second semester. I found that I really enjoyed coding, and although engineering turned out not to be for me, my interest in coding stuck with me as I entered the workforce. As a machinist I was asked to take over programing the robotic arms they used to load and unload machines. I realized that I could make a career out of programming, and I decided to attend the We Can Code IT C# bootcamp in January of 2021. Now that I have completed the We Can Code IT program, I am hoping to begin a career in software development that will allow me to apply my knowledge while continuing to grow as a developer.</p>
